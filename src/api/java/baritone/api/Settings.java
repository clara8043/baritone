     * itself and its paths as it learns new information, as new chunks load. There is no scenario in which having an
     * incorrect cache can cause Baritone to get stuck, take damage, or perform any action it wouldn't otherwise, everything
     * is rechecked once the real chunk is in range.
     * <p>
     * Having a robust cache greatly improves long distance pathfinding, as it's able to go around large scale obstacles
     * before they're in render distance. In fact, when the chunkCaching setting is disabled and Baritone starts anew
     * every time, or when you enter a completely new and very complicated area, it backtracks far more often because it
     * has to build up that cache from scratch. But after it's gone through an area just once, the next time will have zero
     * backtracking, since the entire area is now known and cached.
